The build_bbb argument can be anything you want. I wanted to keep it simply bbb.
However, I cannot do this as my Git Aware Prompt keeps complaining about new content.
If you inspect .gitignore, you will see that it has build* in it. So, the directory prefixed
with build will be ignored. This command will land you in the newly created build
directory. Before moving further, we need to examine this directory. Here, we have a
subdirectory named conf and two files, bblayers.conf and local.conf. We will look
into bblayers.conf in the upcoming chapters. For now, we will go through the contents
of local.conf.
